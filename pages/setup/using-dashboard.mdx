# Using dashboard

## Create a Project

To begin using Unbody for a project, you first need to create a project space ðŸ˜„. Each project serves as a separate container for your data:

- **Separate datasets for different websites**: Create a new project for each dataset.
- **Shared datasets across applications**: A single project is sufficient.

### Steps to Create a Project:

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard Homepage**:
    - Click the "Create a New Project" button.
2. **Configure Your Project**:
    - A dialog box will open. Name your project and set configurations for AI models and other features.
    - Choose from a preset or use the advanced panel for more flexibility.
    - For this guide, select the **Generative OpenAI preset**.
3. **Create the Project**:
    - Click on "Create Project".
    - You will be automatically redirected to the newly created project page.

## **Add Source**

Once on the project page, you can start adding data sources. A **data source** is the origin of your data (e.g., Google Drive, Discord Channel, or GitHub Repository).

### Steps to Add a Source:

1. **Click on "Add New Source"**:
    - This will open a dialog with four steps.
2. **Select a Provider**:
    - Choose the platform where your content is stored (e.g., Google Drive).
    - Learn more about providers.
3. **Connect Unbody to Your Source**:
    - Allow Unbody to access your content from the selected provider.
    - Learn more about our privacy policies.
4. **Set an Entry Point**:
    - Specify where Unbody should find your data on the chosen source.
    - Entry points vary by provider:
        - For **Google Drive**, itâ€™s a "folder".
        - For **Discord**, itâ€™s a "channel".
5. **Initialize Your Content**:
    - Navigate to the next step and click **"Initialize"**.
    - Unbody will index the content from your entry point.
    - Once the process is complete, the dashboard will display the number of records processed.

### Notes:

- The time taken to index content depends on its size.
- Interaction with the content is only possible after indexing is complete.
- Wait until the source status changes to **idle** and the source card shows the processed record count.
