# Start building with Unbody
Unbody is essentially an API that primarily utilizes a GraphQL interface. To interact with Unbody, you can either use GraphQL queries directly or employ one of the SDKs provided. Access to any of the endpoints, whether through direct GraphQL queries or SDKs, requires an API key.

### Obtain an API key
Let's begin by creating an API key. Start from your dashboard and navigate to your project page. You'll see three tabs at the top labeled `sources`, `graphql`, and `settings`. Click on the `settings` tab to navigate to the settings page. Here, locate the `developer-settings` sub-page. This is where you can create an `API-key`.

Now, using this API key together with the `project-id` you can send requests to the API.

This is how you can authorize your API calls.

        Using Unbody typescript client all you need to create a new instance of Unbody SKD we will be using this instance in order to make all various API calls.
        ```typescript copy filename="unbody.ts"
        const unbody = new Unbody({
            apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
            projectId: "<PROJECT_ID>",
        });
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title={"CURL"}>
        ```bash copy
        # Authorized call to Unbody using CURL
        curl -X POST \\
        -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \\
        -H "X-Project-Id: <PROJECT_ID>" \\
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
            -d '{"query": "{ Your GraphQL query here }"}' \\
            https://graphql.unbody.io
            ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title={"Vanilla JS"}>
        ```javascript copy
        // Fetch API
        fetch('https://graphql.unbody.io', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Authorization': 'Bearer <API_KEY>',
                'X-Project-Id': '<PROJECT_ID>',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({query: "{ Your GraphQL query here }"})
        })
        .then(...)

        // Axios
        const axios = require('axios');

        axios.post('https://graphql.unbody.io', {
            query: "{ Your GraphQL query here }"
        }, {
            headers: {
                'Authorization': 'Bearer <API_KEY>',
                'X-Project-Id': '<PROJECT_ID>',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        })
        .then(...)
        ```
    </Tab>
