# Get started with Unbody

Unbody is a platform that automates the entire backend development process you need to build AI-native applications or functionalities, in one API.

Unbody functions as a headless API, which grabs data from any location and in any format, and then processes it with your own choice of AI models, and then return the enhanced data to you via a GraphQL API or one of our SDKs.

## Before you begin
