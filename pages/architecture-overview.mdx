# Overview

Building AI-native products is hard. The tools we’ve used for years—duct-taped stacks, fragmented workflows—weren’t built for this. AI development feels like its own job, separate from everything else.

Unbody changes that. It’s not another tool bolted onto your stack. It’s a complete system: one stack where every piece works together.

The **Core Architecture** is made up of four layers: Backend, API, Frontend, and Utilities. Each layer solves a specific problem developers face when building AI-native apps.

### Backend Layer

The engine of Unbody. Everything starts here:

- **Ingest Data**: Pull from Google Drive, Discord, or your own sources with the Push API.
- **Process and Enrich**: Clean, chunk, and enrich your data to make it usable.
- **Vectorize**: Convert data into vectors for semantic search and recommendations.
- **Store and Serve**: Use structured storage, caching, and CDNs to deliver results fast.

### API Layer

How you interact with your data:

- **GraphQL API**: Query and retrieve enriched AI-ready data.
- **Push API**: Add custom data with schemas you define.
- **Admin API**: Manage projects and data sources programmatically.
- **Media API**: Real-time processing for images and videos.

### Frontend Layer

Everything you need to build interfaces for AI-native apps:

- **Prebuilt Components**: Ready-to-use UI components for React, Vue.js, and others.
- **Customizable**: Fully adaptable to your app’s look and feel.

### Utility Layer

Powerful tools to handle the details:

- **Query Parser**: Convert natural language into structured queries.
- **Reranking**: Fine-tune results for relevance.
- **Accelerators**: Dynamic image and media processing.

Every layer connects seamlessly. You don’t need to manage two stacks anymore—just one system where AI is built in, not bolted on.
