# Backend Layer Overview

The **Backend Layer** is the foundation of Unbody. It handles everything needed to make your data AI-ready: ingesting, processing, enriching, and storing it for seamless retrieval.

Forget juggling pipelines and fragmented systems. With Unbody's Backend Layer, your data flows through a unified, purpose-built system.

## What the Backend Layer Does

1. **Ingests Data**
   * Pull data from platforms like Google Drive and Discord using prebuilt connectors.
   * Add your own custom data sources with the Push API.

2. **Processes Data**
   * Clean and chunk data for better usability.

3. **Enriches Data**
   * Add metadata and context through customizable enrichment pipelines.

4. **Vectorizes Data**
   * Convert processed data into vectors for semantic search, recommendations, and more.

5. **Serves Data**
   * Store data in a schema-based structure and deliver it quickly with built-in caching and a global CDN.

## Why It Matters

AI-native products depend on clean, enriched, and structured data. The Backend Layer handles every step of that process in one place, so you can focus on building features, not managing infrastructure.
