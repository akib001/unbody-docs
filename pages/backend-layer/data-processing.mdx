# Data Processing

Once data is ingested, it needs to be processed to make it usable. In Unbody, **data processing** cleans, chunks, and organizes your data, preparing it for enrichment and vectorization. This step transforms raw data into structured, optimized pieces ready for AI-native workflows.

Every part of Unbody’s data processing is **modular and plugin-based**. You can use our prebuilt strategies or design your own, giving you full flexibility and control.

### Why Data Processing Matters

Raw data is messy and fragmented. Processing **cleans it**, **chunks it**, and **standardizes it**, turning it into something usable for AI workflows. Without this step, your data is chaos.

### Key Functions of Data Processing

### 1. **Transforming Raw Data into Clean Input**

Data often contains irrelevant, inconsistent, or duplicate information.

- **Cleaning** removes noise and errors, ensuring only useful data is processed.
- Example: Stripping out unnecessary HTML tags or correcting malformed entries.

### 2. **Breaking Down Data into Manageable Pieces**

Large datasets or files can’t always be processed as a whole.

- **Chunking** splits data into smaller, logical units to make it easier to enrich and vectorize.
- **Custom Strategies**: Use Unbody’s prebuilt chunkers or create your own. For example, chunking a document by paragraphs vs. sentences can change downstream processing.

### 3. **Standardizing Formats Across Sources**

Data comes in many forms—spreadsheets, PDFs, APIs—each with its quirks.

- **Standardization** ensures all data follows consistent formats, making it compatible across every pipeline step.
- Example: Converting date formats or normalizing text encodings.

### 4. **Handling Complex Formats with Parsers**

Not all formats are straightforward. PDFs, for example, vary widely in structure.

- Unbody includes **four prebuilt PDF parsers** to handle common cases.
- You can also **create custom parsers** for specialized formats.

### Why Unbody’s Processing Stands Out

Unbody’s processing is **modular, flexible, and built for real-world challenges**:

- **Prebuilt solutions** for cleaning, chunking, and parsing.
- **Plugin-based design** lets you modify or create your own strategies.
- **Fully integrated into the Backend Layer**, eliminating the need for external scripts or manual steps.
