# Data Vectorization

After enrichment, data must be transformed into **vectors**—numerical representations that AI models can understand. This is the process of **data vectorization**, which encodes text, images, and other data types into high-dimensional vector spaces. These vectors are the foundation for tasks like **semantic search**, **recommendation systems**, and **generative feedback loops**.

### Why Vectorization Matters

Without vectorization, your enriched data is static and unusable in AI workflows. With it:

- **Semantic Search** becomes possible, retrieving results based on meaning rather than keywords.
- **Recommendations** are powered by comparing vector similarities to find relevant matches.
- **Generative Feedback Loops** gain structured, machine-readable inputs, improving context and performance.

### Types of Vectorization

Unbody supports multiple approaches to vectorization, each suited for specific data and workflows:

### Transformers

Uses pre-trained transformer models to generate embeddings that capture the meaning and context of text. Ideal for tasks like natural language understanding and semantic search.

### Embeddings

Embeddings are dense vector representations of data. They can represent:

- **Text**: Encoded into vectors that capture relationships between words, sentences, or documents.
- **Images**: Transformed into feature-rich embeddings for tasks like object recognition or similarity matching.

Unbody’s vectorization system supports both prebuilt and custom models, enabling flexibility and scalability for your application.

### Configuring Vectorization

Vectorization can be configured through the **Dashboard** or the **Admin API**:

1. **Dashboard**: Select and manage vectorizers for your project with an intuitive interface.
2. **Admin API**: Programmatically integrate or customize vectorization workflows.

### Built-In Vectorizers

Unbody includes several built-in vectorizers optimized for text and images, such as:

- **OpenAI**: Offers granular control with embeddings tailored to various tasks.
- **Transformers**: Open-source models for general-purpose vectorization.
- **Image Vectorizers**: Encode visual data into embeddings for tasks like similarity and tagging.

### Applications of Vectorized Data

Once vectorized, your data powers:

- **Semantic Search**: Deliver results based on context and meaning.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest related items by comparing vector similarities.
- **Generative AI**: Provide structured, machine-readable data to enhance generative workflows.

### Why Unbody’s Vectorization Stands Out

Unbody’s vectorization tools are:

- **Modular**: Supports prebuilt or custom vectorizers.
- **Integrated**: Fully connected to the enrichment pipeline for seamless workflows.
- **Scalable**: Handles diverse data types like text and images, at scale.
