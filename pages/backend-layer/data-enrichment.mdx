# Data Enrichment

Data enrichment is the middleman in your AI pipeline. It takes raw data and transforms it into **knowledge**—adding layers of meaning, context, and metadata. This process is the backbone of the shift from traditional **databases** to true **knowledge bases**.

With enriched data, your applications don’t just store information—they understand and generate insights, forming the foundation for a **generative feedback loop** where enriched outputs can refine future inputs.

### Why Data Enrichment Matters

Raw data lacks meaning on its own. Enrichment turns it into actionable knowledge. For example, it can:

- Add context, like tagging customer reviews with sentiment.
- Extract metadata, such as authors, timestamps, or locations.
- Summarize long documents into concise, searchable abstracts.
- Identify entities like names, places, or organizations.

This process prepares your data for semantic search, personalized recommendations, or generative AI applications.

### How Data Enrichment Works

Enrichment in Unbody is **modular** and supports both prebuilt and custom configurations. Each enhancer performs a specific task, and you can combine them into workflows tailored to your needs.

### Examples of Prebuilt Enhancers

Unbody includes a set of ready-to-use enhancers for common enrichment tasks. Examples include:

- **AutoSummary**: Automatically generate concise summaries of text.
- **AutoKeywords**: Extract key terms from documents.
- **AutoVision**: Process images to:
    - Generate captions.
    - Apply OCR to extract text.
    - Identify and tag objects.
- **Crawlers**: Scrape and structure data from web pages.

These are just a few examples. A full list of available enhancers can be found under **Project Settings** in the [Developer Workflows: Project Settings](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-9N3RT50W3-unbody-ea/developer-workflows/project-settings.md) section.

### Setting Up Enrichment

You can configure data enrichment in two ways:

1. **Dashboard**: Use the Project Settings interface to add and manage enhancers.
2. **Admin API**: Programmatically set up and manage enrichment workflows for advanced control.

Both options are fully documented. Explore technical details in the [Developer Workflows: Data Enrichment](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-9N3RT50W3-unbody-ea/developer-workflows/data-enrichment.md).

### Enrichment Pipelines

An enrichment pipeline combines multiple enhancers to create layered workflows. For example:

1. Extract metadata like titles, timestamps, and authors.
2. Summarize content using AutoSummary.
3. Identify and tag entities for easy retrieval.

Pipelines allow you to design workflows tailored to your data and application needs, whether you're processing text, images, or structured content.

### Why Unbody’s Enrichment Stands Out

Unbody’s enrichment tools are designed for flexibility and scale:

- **Modular**: Add, remove, or combine enhancers to fit your needs.
- **Comprehensive**: Includes prebuilt tools for text, images, and web scraping.
- **Customizable**: Create pipelines that align with your application’s specific requirements.
- **AI-Ready**: Prepares data for semantic search, recommendations, and generative AI.
